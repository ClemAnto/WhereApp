<p><strong>History</strong></p>

<p>The name</p>

<p>The name&nbsp; Cerreto&nbsp; comes from an oak, Turkey oak, Quercus cerris L. once widespread in our peninsula covers wooded, the turkey oak. In Italy we have many towns that have the same name but to identify our Cerreto Sannita is the name that indicates the &#39;belonging to the ancient Samnite territory.</p>

<p>Three are urban settlements that have joined the local people in different eras: Cominium Ocritum (name later popularized in Cominium Cerritum), Sunni village mentioned by Livy during the events of the Second Punic War (which began in 218 BC).</p>

<p>Cominum stood near the fortress of Mount Swan. 846 following the Saracen invasions Cominium was destroyed and the survivors founded downstream center called Cerrito, the Cerreto old.</p>

<p>When the Normans settled in Italy with Roger II in 1130, this Cerreto formed the center of a very powerful lordship, that Sanframondo.</p>

Cerreto time numbered almost 8,000 inhabitants, about half of them died.</p>

<p>the renaissance</p>

<p>The current Cerreto Sannita was built between 1688 and 1696 on the project of the Royal engineer Giovanni Battista Manni and &nbsp;by the will of the Count&nbsp; Marzio Carafa and his brother Marino. The construction of the new town was started immediately after the squaring of the blocks that made the royal engineer Giovan Battista Manni.</p>

<p>The practical experience of the orthogonal system allows you to organize the urban structure with places organized into hierarchies that create a precise set design perspective unique. There are blocks with a plug structure for the workers, to the court for the nobles and block for the places of worship and the clergy. It dominates the urban linearity without walls it &#39;stairs. The reconstruction was also a model of social economy.</p>

<p>This became possible thanks to the&nbsp; &nbsp;Count Carafa who issued several measures for the granting of loans, among them, the construction of small houses with two rooms that the people they were able to pay back in four years with an interest rate of 6%. In just eight years after the disastrous earthquake every citizen had built his own house.</p>
