<p>the identification of&nbsp; Cominium or Cominium Ocritum proposed by scholars of the seventeenth and eighteenth century, with the medieval town of Cerreto Sannita (the remains of which are located not far from the center today) it is unanimously rejected by the current historical and archaeological research that does not appear to agree on recognition of the ancient fortress sannitica.</p>

<p>Additional information on the territory in the early Roman cerretese are deduced by Polybius which mentions the hill Eribiano (perhaps identifiable with Mount Erbano located south-west of Cerreto), in reference to the attempt of Fabio Massimo hinder Hannibal on the way towards by ager Falernus Capua; historian also mentions the river Athurnos, identified by some with the Titerno, near which pitched the Carthaginian general (Fig. 1).</p>

<p>Date back to the tenth century the first documentation on the installation that has been the subject of archaeological research promoted by the City of Cerreto Sannita, from the Archaeological Superintendence of Salerno-Avellino-Benevento-Caserta and the Department of Arts and Cultural Heritage of the Second University of Naples. It was investigating to know in detail the remains of fortified structures, recovering parts obliterated by collapses and Earth; the discovery of archaeological furniture, mostly pottery, also allowed to acquire a large number of data on material culture, that is, the daily lives rebuilt through objects and the socio-economic conditions that have formed the basis.</p>

<p>The reference to a curtem Cerreto cum ipso castle in Chronicon Vulturnense (a cartulary, ie a collection of medieval documents attesting rights of organizations or institutions, bound to preservation) alludes to the existence of a fortified settlement that could be the He mentioned by the same Praeceptum Confirmationis of 22 April 972 with which Emperor Otto I confirmed to Azzone, abbot of the monastery of Santa Sofia in Benevento, property and rights of the institution; expression in Cerreto chapel in honor S (n) c (t) the Martini cum p (er) tinentiis eor (um) is repeated in Praeceptum Confirmationis of Otto II of 18 October and 981 in Praeceptum Confirmationis of Otto III 11 March 999 (Fig. 2).</p>

<p>In the second half of the twelfth century Cerreto figure attributed to the family feud as Sanframondo. The domain of these on Cerreto was interrupted in 1382, when Nicholas was Sanframondi private fiefdoms father for having hosted in his castle Louis of Anjou, betraying Charles of Durazzo: only in 1417 the family will regain possession, losing them permanently in the last quarter of the fifteenth century after the defeat suffered by Ferdinand of Aragon in Pontelandolfo. Diomede Carafa in 1483 was the new recipient of the castrum Cerreti cum Casalibus videlicet S. et Laurenzelli Civitellae: confirmed in 1496 by Frederick III, the rule of the Carafa lasted until the abolition of feudalism. The earthquake of June 5, 1688 that struck Benevento hard enough to have been the origin of the intense activity of reconstruction and building renewal promoted by Cardinal Vincenzo Maria Orsini (archbishop from 1686 to 1724) caused serious damage to the village of the Middle Ages that had be rebuilt a little downstream: the work, sponsored by the feudal lord Marzio Carafa III and Bishop Giovan Battista de Bellis, was implemented by the engineer Giovan Battista Manni and involved the reuse of materials obtained by the removal of the collapses and the shaving of the structures not reusable, highlighted by the archaeological excavations.</p>

<p>The cylindrical tower (Fig. 3) with a sloping base (ie slanted wall, at the base of a wall structure) can be reported back to the Norman-Swabian (XI-XII century) based on two elements: the relief that Cerreto assumed when it became feud of &nbsp;Sanframondo; the architectural features that approach the Magna Turris Montella (Fig. 4) and the towers of other locations not only in Irpinia. It is comparable to the Grosse Tour du Louvre (the second half of the twelfth century estimated height 30 m), the keep of the fortress of Filippo Augusto&nbsp; in Paris, highlighted by the excavations in the Cour Carr&eacute; of the famous French building.</p>

<p>The exceptional size of the cerretese tower in whose outer face are many visible traces of the plaster coating and architectural elements of reuse, is confirmed by the thickness of the walls (3.20 m) and the diameter (outside of about 14 m and internal 7 m): not by chance the building has held up better than others in the earthquake of 1688 which led to the abandonment. Its residential use by the feudal lord is confirmed by a number of important elements: at the summit there is a small storage-tank (Fig. 5) for collecting rainwater, built into the wall, which served the last floor the tower the height of which can be estimated at 28-30 m; the large tank in the compartment of the base of the tower (Fig. 6b) fed by means of a pipe terracotta (Fig. 6a) and from which the water was extracted using the well; bread oven (fig. 7), the penultimate place in the floor as the Magna Turris Castle Montella and other towers that encompass the model of the keep Residential spread to much of Europe. Another connotation that highlights the use of the residential tower is the toilet. Facilities such as the gateway to the third floor for defensive reasons, the fireplace, the toilet (Fig. 8), the sink, the bread oven, are typical of the towers of the twelfth and thirteenth century; It is their own comforts to indicate the function of residence of the structure that had often cylindrical shape; but they are also documented Donjons of quadrangular.</p>

<p>Verified on the west of the cylindrical tower, the palatium (Fig. 9) is the most investigated area during the excavations that revealed the complex stratification. It corresponds to a part of the building of trapezoidal shape, structured in a variety of environments. In addition to palatium was identified a religious building of the sixteenth century identified with the church of St. Martin (Fig. 10): three naves divided by two rows of pillars of which only the plinths, paved with beaten mortar whose remains They are present along the east perimeter wall, the building used as the apse square tower of the city wall. The collapse inside returned some stone elements to spearhead (Fig. 11) and the bearing part of ashlar portals, and fragments of stucco frames related to the decoration of the church (fig. 12).</p>

<p>Inside of it, the small quadrangular room on the north-west was found the plaque indicating the burial area reserved for family Pedullo that bears the inscription: &quot;D (o) O (ptimo) M (aximo) / IO (anne) NICOLAUS / PEDULLO / SIBI HH (haeredibus ac) NEXT (essoribus) / vivis MONUMENT (um) / Mortis Sepul / CHRU F (yesterday) F (uit) / IV NOT IAN / A (Y ear) S (ignore) 1636 &raquo;(fig. 13).</p>

<p>The excavation also brought back to light the walls where there is the square tower (Fig. 14) reused as apse and the crypt of the church of St. Martin (Fig. 15). The four small rooms in which it was divided, were covered with vaults as evidenced by the small shelves (fig. 16) into the walls of context. The discovery of bones, devotional objects such as rosary beads, medals and crosses below the collapse that filled her, confirmed the function crypt of the four small rooms.</p>

<p>North of the square tower, between the structures it supported later, we verify the sacristy of the church of San Martino&nbsp; (Fig. 17) has a floor in beaten mortar, a sink and a toilet compartment. It was reached by a staircase built into the wall south (Fig. 14).</p>

<p>Outside of the classroom of worship they have been found the remains of cobblestone pavement on the road at the side of the church.</p>

<p>It is to be specified if the keep and the defensive system identified by the city walls which are inserted the square tower and the semicircular tower (west of the keep). At one stage late medieval or early modern period dates the construction of palatium. The last step can be read in the collapse of the structures and leaving the site after the earthquake of 1688.</p>


<p>The archaeological investigations carried out between 2012 and 2015 with an excavation in extension have allowed us to recover a fair amount of material especially in areas where the survey was carried to greater depths. They were found several artifacts, mostly pottery, an indestructible material whose shapes can be used in different areas for different functions.</p>

<p>Were to include in the common ceramic pottery functional and necessary for the performance of daily activities, both at home and in other operational areas. It follows that these vessels must meet the criteria of multifunctionality and cheapness.. This does not mean that on the pottery of common use are not made decorations with purely aesthetic purposes, usually very beautiful are the paintings; such as the use of glazed paintings; figurations glazing and enamel.</p>

<p>Some types of containers were used especially in the kitchen to cook: olle (containers that have the diameter of the entrance smaller than that of the belly, and globular body or ovoid), pots, saucepans, pans, lids, texts (ie containers used for baking buns and bread) and fornetti-cover; or to prepare the ingredients and preparing food: mortars and basins (characterized by a diameter greater than the height). Always in the kitchen and pantries to hold and store food solids and liquids they were used jars, jugs, bottles, jars and small dolia. At the table they were used many containers such as plates, cups, bowls, glasses, bottles, jugs, amphorae, serving dishes. They were used to wash basins, as well as for personal toiletries were used ointment, bowls and chamber pots.</p>

<p>The macroscopic examination of the clay has allowed to distinguish different types of pastes that can be grouped in two large sets, namely those &quot;purified&quot; where included are few or none at all and those &quot;raw&quot;, including rich of different nature and dimension. The degree of purification of doughs reflects the functional destination of the finished product: very purified mixtures could be used for the pottery intended to table (pitchers, cups, plates), while for containers intended for the storage of foodstuffs or those used in the kitchen (olle ) they were used mixtures &quot;raw&quot;. The ceramic material dated between the twelfth and sixteenth century, found in palatium you can understand the eating habits and the economic conditions of the area residents. It consists mostly of ceramic tableware and fire that is specific comparisons within Naples. Among the documented forms prevail open ones, which include plates, bowls, cups, including those closed they are jugs and jars.</p>

<p>Of particular note plates, saucers, bowls and cups in graffiti, monochrome glazed white glazed painted, protomajolica, glazed of&nbsp; transition and glazed with&nbsp; blue patterned pots and glazed</p>

<p><strong>Fire glazed </strong></p>

<p>It is the pottery used for cooking food, which supports direct contact and repeated by fire. The clay used is rich in quartz sand and iron oxides, low lime and alkali. It is a technical and aesthetic improvement in the production of cookware. The time of its peak is between the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The materials found documenting a repertoire morphologically reduced, characterized by the dominance of closed forms (jars) for the preparation of semi-liquid foods or soups on open forms (pots and pans) intended for cooking food and semisolid meat. There are funds and edges of pots and glazed inside edge.</p>


<p><strong>Vitrified monochrome and painted </strong></p>

<p>It is the ceramic tableware characterized by a glassy coating. The main components of the showcase are silica in the form of quartz and lead oxides: such a mixture, applied on the article in the green state or cookie, during baking is transformed into a casing which adheres to the ceramic body waterproofing it giving smoothness and gloss . The showcase usually reveals the color of the clay but loses transparency if before cooking has been enriched with inorganic pigments such as iron oxide and copper, giving a wide range of colors from light yellow to red to brown, from blue to green: they were lying in various combinations on the outer surface in the closed forms, within in the open. Painted and glazed artifacts are documented in Campania in the twelfth and fifteenth centuries. The ornamental repertoire is characterized by a good variety of types: zoomorphic and geometric motifs.</p>


<p><strong>Protomajolica</strong></p>

<p>It is defined&nbsp; majolica which was produced in Sicily by the twelfth-early thirteenth century widespread in the rest of southern Italy between the thirteenth and fourteenth. It is a ceramic coated with a vitreous layer, impermeable and opaque on which the artisan drew the decorative motifs using colors obtained by grinding of oxides of iron, copper and manganese (yellow, green, brown-black-red). During the second firing consolidates the glassy coating that for the presence of tin oxide is more or less white and shiny. The decoration is incorporated by enamel maintaining boundaries are not always precise. The wide spread of protomajolica found in contexts of the whole of Campania and much of the South, suggesting the presence of several production centers that distributed artifacts: these certainly could not miss in the kit of every feudal court, although small. The high cost of the pond and the employed, the protomajolica be regarded as a luxury product whose simple use in everyday banquet allowed to flaunt the economic condition of the owner.</p>


<p><strong>Glazed of transition </strong></p>

<p>Despite having several points of contact with the protomajolica, the glazed transition produced between the fourteenth and sixteenth century is a version of the glazed stannifera characterized by morphological diversity and ornamental. It was found that the enamel, brighter and often, can cover both surfaces in order not to reveal the underlying ceramic body.</p>


<p><strong>Graffito </strong></p>

<p>A variation of glazed can be considered the graffito which is defined for the scratching decoration done with a bit of wood or metal on engobing. This was obtained by diluting in water purified clay after firing created a matte coating, permeable to liquids. irregular fields of color applied with broad brushstrokes filled figures graphite. The repertory&nbsp; is characterized by geometrical and vegetal reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<p><strong>White glazed monochrome</strong></p>

<p>Also known as white majolica, it is a ceramic coating stanniferous present mostly in the table service from the late Middle Ages to the modern age both in hospitals or convents both in aristocratic dwellings in residential buildings of upper-middle class. Limit its use to an enclosed area contrasts with the widespread attested throughout Italy.</p>


<p><strong>Glazed with blue paints</strong></p>

<p>Although not documented in high percentage, this production appears in numerous settlements inland Campania. It is characterized by the ceramic coating of white enamel on which were drawn motifs in blue-blue. Production of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.</p>


<p><strong>Renaissance Majolicas</strong></p>

<p>Inside&nbsp; this class majolicas&nbsp; are grouped manufactured in the centuries XVII-XIX. They were characterized by polychrome decorations plant and anthropomorphic.</p>
